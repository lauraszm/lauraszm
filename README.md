### My developer stack
⚡ **Front-End:** Angular | Vue | TypeScript | JavaScript  
⚙️ **Back-End:** Node.js | Express | C# | Java  
🗄️ **Databases:** SQL | MongoDB  
🎨 **Special Skills:** Googling errors like a pro, adding `console.log()` everywhere

### 🎢 My Coding Life in Emojis:
💡 Idea → 🎨 Code → 🔥 Break Everything (and probably cry) → 🐛 Debug → 🎉 Finally Works → 💤 Sleep? 

### 📜 My Life History in Emojis
📚 🏺 → 🎭📅 → ✈️🇬🇧 → 💻🛠️ → ✈️🇦🇷 → 👩‍💻🚀

📚 Studied Anthropology (fun fact: I can analyze both human cultures and messy codebases)
🎭📅 Worked as Assistant & Event Planner (aka mastering the art of multitasking)
✈️🇬🇧 Moved to London (because why not?)
💻🛠️ Got My First Tech Job in Support (turns out, I like fixing things)
✈️🇦🇷 Came Back to Buenos Aires (home sweet home)
👩‍💻🚀 Became a Full Stack Developer (now I build things and then fix them)

### 🚀 Things I'm Cooking Up:
🛠 **Coffee Folks:** A special place for specialty coffee lovers ☕  built in NodeJS + Express and VueJS
📚 Learning **random tech things** just because I can (AKA studying like crazy after work)
💡 Open to **collabs, ideas, or just geeky chats!** Hit me up!

### 🎉 Fun Facts:
- 🔥 Loves BBQ & Coding → Because both require patience, skill, and the right amount of heat
- 🏆 "It worked on my machine" = my proudest achievement  
- 🐛 I believe debugging is 90% detective work, 10% crying . Or the other way around, it depends on the day
